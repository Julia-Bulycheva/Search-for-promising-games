# Searching for patterns that determine the success of a computer game

Using data on video game sales, user and expert ratings, genres, and platforms, patterns determining the success of a game were identified. Parameters determining game success in different regions of the world were also identified. Based on this, a report was prepared for a computer game store to plan advertising campaigns. Data preprocessing and analysis were conducted, and a relevant time period for analysis was selected. User profiles for each region were created. Hypotheses were tested: whether the average user ratings for the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same and whether the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. The Student's t-test for independent samples was used for the analysis.
